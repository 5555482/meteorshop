￼Deloitte Digital Development Test
You’ve been asked to develop a responsive website for a clothing retailer.
The retailer sells six different categories of clothes:
1. women’s footwear,
2. men’s footwear,
3. women’s casualwear,
4. men’s casualwear,
5. women’s formalwear and
6. men’s formalwear.
The page that you develop should display all of the available products, as well as a shopping cart to which they can be added.

Criteria
We will use this development test to assess how well you write code. There is no right or wrong answer. Functional correctness is important, but we will assess your solution holistically.
You should tackle as many of the user stories as you can in priority order. We expect you to spend approximately t​hree hours​on this but there is no strict time limit.
There is no restriction on using third party libraries. You may use any technology you feel is appropriate.
You should also feel free to use mocks as appropriate, e.g. you can store product data in a flat file or in a constant, rather than create a database. Please isolate mocked data or services as appropriate.
You will be assessed on the q​uality of your code,​f​unctional correctness​and y​our approach to quality assurance and testing.​
Please commit your code to Github, in a public repository that does not mention Deloitte. Please send the URL of that repository to your Makers Academy representative.
Please include a README file that describes how to build and run the code, and the code layout at a high level to help us understand where to look. Please also describe your approach and your thinking.
